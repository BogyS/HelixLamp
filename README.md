# 🌈 RGB Double Helix Lamp with Arduino Nano

This project is a customizable RGB lamp inspired by the original [RGB Double Helix Lamp - EasyPrint](https://www.printables.com/model/62043-rgb-double-helix-lamp-easyprint). 
It uses an **Arduino Nano** and the **FastLED** library to create dynamic LED lighting effects.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

- Arduino code to control individually addressable RGB LEDs (WS2812 or similar)
- Multiple lighting effects (rainbow, fade, color transitions, etc.)
- 3D printed enclosure (external source)
- Simple and clean hardware setup

## 📦 What You Need

- Arduino Nano (or compatible)
- WS2812 LED strip
- 5V USB power supply
- Jumper wires, 330Ω resistor (on DIN line), 470µF capacitor, push button
- 3D printed parts: [Printables model link](https://www.printables.com/model/62043-rgb-double-helix-lamp-easyprint)
